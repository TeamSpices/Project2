<h1>Reccomendations</h1>  


<p> We hope that you have a pleasant and safe trip to Austria and wish to request that you please take a few minutes to read the following useful information. </p>

<p> Before travelling, make sure if you need a visa to come to Peru and that you are carrying a valid passport. </p>

 <li>Money in Vienna. Foreign money and euros can be brought in and out of Vienna without any restrictions. The euro, the single European currency, is the official currency of Austria and 12 other participating countries.  When negotiating with vendors it is best to carry small amounts of money because they usually carry small amounts of change. </li>
